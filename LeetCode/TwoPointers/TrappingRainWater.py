# This code calculates the amount of water that can be trapped between the bars represented by the heights in the list.
# It uses two arrays to keep track of the maximum heights to the left and right of each bar.
# The water trapped above each bar is the minimum of the left and right maximum heights minus the height of the bar itself.
# The total water trapped is the sum of the water above each bar.
